# 7amma Fripe  
A full stack MERN e-commerce project.  
I'm using [sou9_api](https://github.com/ayoub3bidi/sou9_api) project for Back-end and the UI of the main branch.  
Edit: the project is still not complete but I will come back to finish it soon.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
